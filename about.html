        <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm currently a Data Science major with a minor in Design and Innovation in Engineering at Northeastern University. My passion lies in the power of data to drive informed decision-making and the art of visualizing complex stories through data. 
            I excel in elevating user and customer experiences, merging data insights with design thinking.</p>

        <p>My experience as a Data Analyst Co-op at the MBTA has provided me with hands-on experience in utilizing Tableau and Python to extract, transform, and analyze procurement and financial data, creating insightful visualizations accessible company-wide. 
            This experience has honed my skills in transforming raw data into actionable insights. 
            Additionally, I was able to perfect my client work by effectively explaining data trends and complex findings to individuals outside my technical department, demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams.</p>
        <p>
            I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities in this dynamic field, where I can apply my skills, gain invaluable experience, and contribute to data-driven innovation.
