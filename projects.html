                    <!-- Project details go here -->
                    We used maternal health data, including information such as blood sugar level,
                    age, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate to classify the level of risk of the pregnancy. 
                    Using three different classification models as well as various data visualization techniques, 
                    we were able to analyze our data and report our findings. We also attempted a Deep Learning, 
                    Dense Layer model to perform three-fold classification and hopefully find accurate results.

                    The ConcertCrew App enables concert goers to find their concert buddies, otherwise known 
                    as their "Concert Crew." Going to concerts alone seems a little daunting, so we wanted to find a way 
                    to connect people who love the same music and want to see it live! We designed and implemented our app 
                    prototype using design principles and user research.

                    This project involved both hardware and software components. I was able to work on all parts of this Push Up Counter 
                    inclusing the software and code that enabled it to complete tasks such as keeping track of the user's high score and updating it, 
                    and pushing out a protein bar for the winner, as well as the wiring behind the figure and the actual creation of the shape and look of the figure. 
                    This project was very fun and involved a ton of work.

                    Based on the ingredients and previous things one has cooked, we developed a recommendation engine for potential recipes users would be interested in cooking.

                    Pickasso App design involved a lot of prior research to learn from apps that already exist and design patterns that already do well. 
                    We created our own app designs so there are three different looks within our project report. This was so fun to work on 
                    and learn about what museum goers look out for during their museum visits.

                    This Boston-based food database project utilized SQL and a Java GUI. Depending on the user's filters, they are able to 
                    select restaurants and view more details about them.

                    <!-- Project details go here -->
                    We converted snippets of Pokémon theme music and Mozart music to spectrograms to analyze them and see if our neural network models could find a clear distinction between the two. 
                    We ended up getting pretty high accuracy for all of our models.
